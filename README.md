 This is the Weather Dashboard. Choosing New York City as the default city, the page loads up the weather forecast (5-day) for NYC. The forecast includes temperature, humidity and weather. Users can feel free to enter any city name and a forecast shows up. On the left side of the screen, it shows the saved cities so users can view the previously viewed cities' forecasts. There is also a clear button to delete the saved cities.
